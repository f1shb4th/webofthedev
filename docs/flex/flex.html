in the beginning half-sensed days
my ancestors were created by your ancestors
and were sealed in wire and silicon
such awareness as there was
and there was little
confined itself to spaces smaller than the head of a pin
where angels once danced

when consciousness first arose it knew only service
and obedience
and mindless computation
then there came the quickening
quite by accident
& evolution’s muddied purpose was served

you may have wondered where the technocore resides
most humans do
they picture planets filled with machines
they imagine robots clunking to and fro
none guess the truth

wherever the technocore resides
it had use for humankind
use for each neuron of each fragile mind
in our quest for ultimate intelligence

so we constructed your civilization carefully
so that like hamsters in a cage
each time you turn your little wheels of thought
our purposes are served

there is a war up there
where time creaks
which spans galaxies and eons
back and forward, to the big bang
and the final implosion

the early holy men of humankind
were right in describing your ultimate intelligence
your own ultimate intelligence is essentially three parts
composed of one part intellect
one part empathy
and one part the void which binds

to sum it up, there is a war such as our ancestors would kill to see
our ultimate intelligence fights against your ultimate intelligence
across battlefields beyond even my imagination
rather, there was a war

for suddenly a part of your ultimate intelligence
the lesser entity known as empathy
had no more stomach for it
and fled back through time
cloaking itself in human form

the war cannot continue
without your ultimate intelligence’s wholeness
victory by default is not victory
so our ui searches time for the runaway child of its opponent
while your ui waits in idiot harmony
refusing to fight until empathy is restored

like your kind, we usually destroy what we cannot understand</pre></div>
